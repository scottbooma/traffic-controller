## Traffic Controller

This simple Spring Boot application allows users the ability to control traffic intersections within a city/town. Through simple HTTP requests a user has the ability to:
  - Create a unique intersection
  - Start and stop the lights at a specific intersection
  - Set the lights to a specific color at an intersection
  - Get the current colors of the lights at an intersection
  - If an authorizized emergency services user, set all lights at an intersection to red
  - Update specific timing configurations of an intersection
